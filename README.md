A recreation of the [Landmarks sample app](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui) used to educate developers about SwiftUI. This codebase was created as an educational exercise to help us and other developers learn SwiftUI and have a comparison to a similar app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

Read our [blog post](https://medium.com/flutter-nyc/building-the-swiftui-sample-app-in-flutter-67bb4f9c571c) that goes into detail about how we built the Flutter app and what we think about the differences between SwiftUI and Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Using Maps

The maps will need an API key to work, [which you can get here.](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)

After you have acquired one, replace "YOUR KEY HERE" with your API key in the main `AndroidManifest.xml` file and in `AppDelegate.swift`.
